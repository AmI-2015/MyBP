<p>The system is able to find free places using intelligent algorithms and to maintain the safety of the bike through an identification system. This identification system will be provided only to registered users: it means that everyone could exploit MyBP, but the system provides some privileges for the identificated ones.</p>

<p>MyBP exploits a platform where the user can place his bike. When a bike is placed on the platform a pressure sensor detects its presence and registers it in a database.</p>

<p>MyBP exploits the connection between the system and identified user’s phone to display the best path to reach the bike. Moreover if the identified user does not go towards his bike at the end of his daily schedule, then MyBP smartly alerts him.</p>

Moreover, when someone try to steal your bike a rumorous alarm will be programmed to loudly ring. You can look through the webcam the conditions of your bike and even the app sends you a picture when someone tries to steal your bike (variation on the pressure sensor).</p></li>

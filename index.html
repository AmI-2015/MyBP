<p>The system is able to find free places using intelligent algorithms and to maintain the safety of the bike through an identification system. This identification system will be provided to the only registered users, it means that everyone could exploit MyBP, but for the one identificated the system provides some privileges.</p>

<p>MyBP exploits a platform where the user can place his bike. (This platform is laid down four springs), When a bike is placed on the platform a pressure sensor detects its presence and registers it in a database.</p>

<p>MyBP exploits the connection between the system and identified user’s phone to display the best path to reach the bike. (It will be implemented a way that) Moreover  if the identified user does not go towards his bike at the end of his daily schedule, then MyBP smartly alerts him.</p>

<a id="what-mybikeplace-does" class="anchor" href="#what-mybikeplace-does" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What MyBikePlace does</h1>

<p>Imagine you’re arriving at Smart “Citadella Politecnico” with your bike. Maybe you’re late and you would like to find the nearest place to your classroom to leave quickly and safely your bolid but... you don’t know exactly where!
What you’ve to do is take your phone, unlock it and simply open MyBikePlace app.
It will do all the rest!
MyBikePlace suggests you the nearest place to you or, if you prefer, to your classroom. MyBikePlace app also helps you reach your bike if you’re forgetting it, showing where you parked it on the campus map. 
Moreover, if you register your arrival at the parking and someone else tries to stole your bike, MyBP avoids the theft warning you with a notification and activating an alarm at the stand.</p>

<h2>
<a id="en-plein-air" class="anchor" href="#en-plein-air" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>En Plein Air</h2>

<p>MyBikePlace finds its application in the open spaces within the campus, wherever the bike can be locked at the appropriate Politecnico stand. </p>

<h2>
<a id="for-whom" class="anchor" href="#for-whom" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>For Whom?</h2>

<p>MyBikePlace is meant to everyone who loves riding bike, reaching the campus quickly and not losing time looking for a bike place.</p>

<h2>
<a id="and-for-what" class="anchor" href="#and-for-what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>...and For What?</h2>

<p>A tidy, efficient and more good looking campus also passes through a better organization of its open spaces. Students, professors and all the Smart Citadella Politecnico users can achieve this goal doing every little thing smartly. The bike management is one of them and MyBP is the proper tool.</p>

<h2>
<a id="efficient-environment" class="anchor" href="#efficient-environment" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Efficient Environment</h2>

<p>Avoid to annoying the users is one of MyBP aim. At environment layer this means not modify users routine, not changing the way they use bikes or lock them when it’s time to go to classroom. Summing up MyBP project doesn’t act environmentally. Rather it advises you on the environment, making its use easier and more efficient.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SENSING : every bike place has a pressure sensor linked with a footboard on which the bike is parking. There is also a webcam that allows you to monitor your bike during the day and also to take a picture of a possible thief. Also users are tracked via gps.</p></li>
<li><p>REASONING : when you approach at politecnico MyBP calculate the nearest free place in which you can leave your bike. After you have finished your lessons and you want to return home MyBP suggests you where you had parked your bike and advise if you take a wrong route to reach it. You can choose a setting which indicates to MyBP that you would like to park your bike in the nearest place at the classroom in which you start or finish your daily lessons. After you have parked the bike MyBP associates your bike to a id number and use it to communicate with you. </p></li>
<li><p>ACTING: MyBP alerts you when you pass near a free place, furthermore provides indications to find your bike or the most suitable path to reach the place where you had parked. Moreover, when someone try to steal your bike a rumorous alarm will be programmed to loudly ring. You can look through the webcam the conditions of your bike and even the app sends you a picture when someone tries to steal your bike (variation on the pressure sensor).</p></li>
<li><p>INTERACTING:  users choose operative mode, for example, one operative mode could be to find a place near your class lesson based on your schedule or another one could be to look for a free place. User can also decide to use MyBP service for control the bike or only park the bike.</p></li>

<a id="ami-features" class="anchor" href="#ami-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AmI Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>SENSITIVE: sensing bikes presence and user real time position; </p></li>
<li><p>RESPONSIVE: acoustic and lighting warning at each group of stands </p></li>
<li><p>ADAPTIVE: not intrusive notification. The system acquires statistics about user weekly arrivals and departures, elaborates datas, understands when and if is necessary to advise users.

<li><p>TRANSPARENT: only minimum “efforts” are required  (ex NFC tag or Wireless key)</p></li>
<li><p>UBIQUITOUS: bike stands spread all over the campus connected to remote repo (GitHub). Smartphone app to reach all users wherever they are.</p></li>
<li><p>INTELLIGENT: algorithms to determinate the nearest place to the user,to interpret acquired data and statistics, to manage the several stand blocks hardware, to determinate “dangerous” situation (thefts,  bike forgetfulness). </p></li>
</ul>

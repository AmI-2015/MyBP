{"name":"MyBikePlace","tagline":"MyBP - https://github.com/AmI-2015/MyBP","body":"# Deliverable 2\r\n\r\n# Purposes\r\n\r\nThe system is able to find free places using intelligent algorithms and to maintain the safety of the bike through an identification system. This identification system will be provided only to registered users: it means that everyone could exploit MyBP, but the system provides some privileges for the identificated ones.\r\n\r\nMyBP exploits a platform where the user can place his bike. When a bike is placed on the platform a pressure sensor detects its presence and registers it in a database.\r\n\r\nMyBP exploits the connection between the system and identified user’s phone to display the best path to reach the bike. Moreover if the identified user does not go towards his bike at the end of his daily schedule, then MyBP smartly alerts him.\r\n\r\n# Definitions\r\n\r\n## Glossary\r\n* __MyBP Station__ is the entire system (sensors + raspberry + MyBP Ring) present at every bike station in the Polito’s Campus\r\n* __MyBP Board__ is the platform which detects bike presence at each stand\r\n* __MyPU__ is the registered user that identifies himself to the MyBP Board\r\n* __MyDis__ is the way which allows a MyPU to disconnect the bike from the place and to free place for other users\r\n* __MyRing__ is an lighting-acoustic alarm placed on the MyBP Station \r\n\r\n## Actors\r\n\r\nMyBP can be exploited completely by students, professors and whoever needs to place his bike in Politecnico di Torino Campus.\r\n\r\n# Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n1. MyBP provides a registration form to create a personal account for the user.\r\n2. MyBP provides a login/logout for users through the mobile app.\t\r\n3. MyBP provides a live map of the free places on the mobile app for all the users.\r\n4. MyBP identifies an user exploiting an NFC tag.\r\n5. MyBP alerts the MyPU if his bike is taken without MyDis.\r\n6. MyRing loudly rings whenever a bike is taken without MyDis.\r\n7. Using own accounts, users can define what kind of research MyBP has to do: *”Research by schedule”* allows to find the nearest place according to the daily user schedule; *”Research for nearest place”* allows to find the nearest place respect to the instantaneous position of the user.\r\n8. MyBP smartly alerts an identified user if he does not go towards his bike at the end of his daily schedule.\r\n9. *evaluating: MyBP alerts the MyPU  sending a photo/video of the designated position when MyRing is activated*\r\n\r\n# Non Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n1. MyBP needs to be compatible with Android *[evaluating iOs implementation]* \r\n2. MyBP needs to be on according to the timetable of the Polito’s Campus (provided through Google Calendar).\r\n3. MyBP exploits researching algorithms directly using Google Maps\r\n4. The registration at the stand has to occur in a time interval under one second\r\n\r\n\r\n# Deliverable 1\r\n# What MyBikePlace does\r\n\r\nImagine you’re arriving at Smart “Citadella Politecnico” with your bike. Maybe you’re late and you would like to find the nearest place to your classroom to leave quickly and safely your bolid but... you don’t know exactly where!\r\nWhat you’ve to do is take your phone, unlock it and simply open MyBikePlace app.\r\nIt will do all the rest!\r\nMyBikePlace suggests you the nearest place to you or, if you prefer, to your classroom. MyBikePlace app also helps you reach your bike if you’re forgetting it, showing where you parked it on the campus map. \r\nMoreover, if you register your arrival at the parking and someone else tries to stole your bike, MyBP avoids the theft warning you with a notification and activating an alarm at the stand.\r\n\r\n# Targets and Goals\r\n## En Plein Air\r\n\r\nMyBikePlace finds its application in the open spaces within the campus, wherever the bike can be locked at the appropriate Politecnico stand. \r\n\r\n## For Whom?\r\n\r\nMyBikePlace is meant to everyone who loves riding bike, reaching the campus quickly and not losing time looking for a bike place.\r\n\r\n## ...and For What?\r\n\r\nA tidy, efficient and more good looking campus also passes through a better organization of its open spaces. Students, professors and all the Smart Citadella Politecnico users can achieve this goal doing every little thing smartly. The bike management is one of them and MyBP is the proper tool.\r\n\r\n## Efficient Environment\r\n\r\nAvoid to annoying the users is one of MyBP aim. At environment layer this means not modify users routine, not changing the way they use bikes or lock them when it’s time to go to classroom. Summing up MyBP project doesn’t act environmentally. Rather it advises you on the environment, making its use easier and more efficient.\r\n\r\n# Why Use MyBP\r\n\r\nWe guess you know that your bicycles are a good small taste for petty thieves! Don’t you? In the Politecnico’s Campus it is a real problem that affects anyone wants to leave his bike all alone in the widespread free places that the campus provides to park own bikes. \r\nSo that, MyBP aims to solve this problem, improving the custody of your bike, so you don’t worry about your pour and lonely bike while your lesson is so hard that you have to find a way to escape it or you hurry have to reach your students for a briefing, you will not prey to find your bike as well as you parked it in the morning, but you will just have to use the right platform that MyBP will provide you. What if some funny guy wants to kid you and take your bike away? Simply he can’t! Yeah, because MyBP can even provide you informations about your bike “health” by monitoring it!! \r\nNow, let’s think to your long and long and long day, at the end, trust us, you won’t even remember where you have parked your bike. No problems, MyBP will do it for you when your day is finished and you’re wondering where you have to go. Do not forget to update your schedule! Let’s try it! \r\n\r\n# MyBikePlace makes and Ambient Intelligent\r\n\r\n## The Ambient Intelligent Fingerprints\r\n\r\n* SENSING : every bike place has a pressure sensor linked with a footboard on which the bike is parking. There is also a webcam that allows you to monitor your bike during the day and also to take a picture of a possible thief. Also users are tracked via gps.\r\n\r\n* REASONING : when you approach at politecnico MyBP calculate the nearest free place in which you can leave your bike. After you have finished your lessons and you want to return home MyBP suggests you where you had parked your bike and advise if you take a wrong route to reach it. You can choose a setting which indicates to MyBP that you would like to park your bike in the nearest place at the classroom in which you start or finish your daily lessons. After you have parked the bike MyBP associates your bike to a id number and use it to communicate with you. \r\n\r\n* ACTING: MyBP alerts you when you pass near a free place, furthermore provides indications to find your bike or the most suitable path to reach the place where you had parked. Moreover, when someone try to steal your bike a rumorous alarm will be programmed to loudly ring. You can look through the webcam the conditions of your bike and even the app sends you a picture when someone tries to steal your bike (variation on the pressure sensor).\r\n\r\n* INTERACTING:  users choose operative mode, for example, one operative mode could be to find a place near your class lesson based on your schedule or another one could be to look for a free place. User can also decide to use MyBP service for control the bike or only park the bike.\r\n\r\n## AmI Features\r\n\r\n* SENSITIVE: sensing bikes presence and user real time position; \r\n\r\n* RESPONSIVE: acoustic and lighting warning at each group of stands \r\n\r\n* ADAPTIVE: not intrusive notification. The system acquires statistics about user weekly arrivals and departures, elaborates datas, understands when and if is necessary to advise users. It automatically detects where the first lesson of the day takes place, through semester timetable downloadable from Politecnico website, in order to point out the smartest bike parking lot; \r\n\r\n* TRANSPARENT: only minimum “efforts” are required  (ex NFC tag or Wireless key)\r\n\r\n* UBIQUITOUS: bike stands spread all over the campus connected to remote repo (GitHub). Smartphone app to reach all users wherever they are.\r\n\r\n* INTELLIGENT: algorithms to determinate the nearest place to the user,to interpret acquired data and statistics, to manage the several stand blocks hardware, to determinate “dangerous” situation (thefts,  bike forgetfulness). \r\n\r\n# OPEN ISSUE\r\n\r\n* Programming an app working on a map (easy way to import from google maps?)\r\n* Implementing a mechanical platform for the bikes \r\n* Thinking about the best (and smartest) way to perform the users login at the parking lot\r\n\r\n# MyBPTeam\r\n\r\n<table style=\"width:100%\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>ID</td>\r\n    <td>Last Name</td> \r\n    <td>First Name</td>\r\n    <td>email</td>\r\n    <td>GitID</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>193037</td>\r\n    <td>Cornelio</td> \r\n    <td>Marco</td>\r\n    <td>murka93@libero.it</td>\r\n    <td>corne93</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>191223</td>\r\n    <td>di Girolamo</td> \r\n    <td>Michele</td>\r\n    <td>michele.digirolamo.to@gmail.com</td>\r\n    <td>MicheledG</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>195489</td>\r\n    <td>Laterza</td> \r\n    <td>Tommaso</td>\r\n    <td>tommasoltrz@gmail.com</td>\r\n    <td>tommasoltrz</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>194202</td>\r\n    <td>Maiorano</td> \r\n    <td>Damian</td>\r\n    <td>damian.maiorano.93@gmail.com</td>\r\n    <td>gadfly93</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

{"name":"MyBikePlace","tagline":"","body":"# Vision\r\n## What MyBikePlace does\r\nImagine you’re arriving at Smart “Citadella Politecnico” with your bike. Maybe you’re late and you would like to find the nearest place to your classroom to leave quickly and safely your bolid but... you don’t know exactly where!\r\nWhat you’ve to do is take your phone, unlock it and simply open MyBikePlace app.\r\nIt will do all the rest!\r\nMyBikePlace suggests you the nearest place to you or, if you prefer, to your classroom. MyBikePlace app also helps you reach your bike if you’re forgetting it, showing where you parked it on the campus map. \r\nMoreover, if you register your arrival at the parking and someone else tries to stole your bike, MyBP avoids the theft warning you with a notification and activating an alarm at the stand.\r\n## En Plein Air\r\nMyBikePlace finds its application in the open spaces within the campus, wherever the bike can be locked at the appropriate Politecnico stand. \r\n## For Whom?\r\nMyBikePlace is meant to everyone who loves riding bike, reaching the campus quickly and not losing time looking for a bike place.\r\n## ...and For What?\r\nA tidy, efficient and more good looking campus also passes through a better organization of its open spaces. Students, professors and all the Smart Citadella Politecnico users can achieve this goal doing every little thing smartly. The bike management is one of them and MyBP is the proper tool.\r\n## Efficient Environment\r\nAvoid to annoying the users is one of MyBP aim. At environment layer this means not modify users routine, not changing the way they use bikes or lock them when it’s time to go to classroom. Summing up MyBP project doesn’t act environmentally. Rather it advises you on the environment, making its use easier and more efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
